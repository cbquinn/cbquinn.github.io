## Understanding the history of red fox in North America
I am currently collaborating with fur trapping associations throughout Canada to obtain a more representative subset of red fox samples in order to better undertand their evolutionary history within North America. As part of making this effort a success, I have prioritized transparent communication by conducting local media outreach efforts.

## Sacramento Valley Red Fox Project
This long-term study began in 2010, shortly after the [discovery of an endemic subspecies of red fox](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10592-010-0053-4) within the Sacramento Valley! It was previously believed that these foxes were introduced to the California lowlands via fur farms, however genetic studies show that they are actually most closely related to the endangered Sierra Nevada red fox. \
