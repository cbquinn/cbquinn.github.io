I use genetic and genomic tools to inform the conservation of wildlife populations. I focus on small, isolated, and rare populations that possess a subset of the genetic diversity of their historical countermarks. I combine **noninvasive DNA** with traditional field methods to provide information for data-scarce taxa and **genomic analyses** to investigate how complex genetic factors interact in small popualtions, including inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression, maintenace of local adaptations, and adaptive introgression.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu) (MECU) at the University of California, Davis. I have projects using whole genomes to 1) investigate inbreeding of the Sierra Nevada red fox and other isolated montane populations, and 2) the evolutionary history of red wolves and other historical North American canis species.
