My research is broadly focused on the evolutionary ecology of terrestrial wildlife. I incorporate traditional ecological field methods with genomic tools to investigate how both natural and anthropogenic drivers influence evolutionary processes including speciation, hybridization, adaptation, and shifting range dynamics. 

As a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu) at the University of California, Davis, I am currently investigating the impacts of secondary contact and hybridization between distinct canid lineages, focusing on two different systems, the red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) and the gray fox (*Urocyon cinereoargenteus*). These vary both in the origins of secondary contact (anthropogenic vs. natural range expansion) and in the level of divergence between lineages, making them valuable systems to explore the mechanisms maintaining lineage boundaries as well as the role of selective introgression (i.e. the sharing of beneficial genetic variation) in the evolution of these lineages.
