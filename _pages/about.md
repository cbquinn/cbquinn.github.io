# About Me
I am an ecologist and evolutionary biologist with a passion for all things wildlife, though strongly biased towards those of the mammalian variety. As a Ph.D. Candidate in the Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit at the University of California, Davis, my research is broadly focused on the evolutionary ecology of terrestrial wildlife, and I am motivated largely by a desire to combat the global decline of carnivore populations. I incorporate traditional ecological field methods with genomic tools to investigate how both natural and anthropogenic drivers influence evolutionary processes including speciation, adaptation, and shifting range dynamics. 

# Education
* B.S. in Evolution, Ecology, and Biodiversity, University of California, Davis, 2012
