My research is broadly focused on the evolutionary ecology of terrestrial wildlife. I incorporate traditional ecological field methods with genomic tools to investigate how both natural and anthropogenic drivers influence evolutionary processes including speciation, hybridization, adaptation, and shifting range dynamics. As a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Mammalian Ecology and Conservation Unit](https://mecu.ucdavis.edu) at the University of California, Davis, I am currently investigating the impacts of secondary contact between distinct canid lineages that originated through natural vs anthropogenic range expansions, and exploring the role varying levels of divergence playys in maintaining boundaries between lineages.
